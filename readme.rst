How to set up
**************
1. Create a new phpmyadmin user and login. Switch to the import tab and choose the 'csk.sql' file in the root directory of this project.
This creates a table 'users' that has all the fields we need.

2. Open the 'application/config/database.php' file and change the username and password fields to correspond to the details of the account you created.

3. In the same folder as above, edit the email.php file and change the 'smtp_user' and 'smtp_pass' fileds, and if needed the 'smtp_host' and 'smtp_port' fields.
